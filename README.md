# Distance Measurement System using Magnetic Fields

The measurement system that has been investigated uses knowledge of how magnetic fields permeate through space. This project was done in order to create a sensing tool to determine the distance between two moving carts that follow each other along a track. When the distance between the carts decreases and a crash is evident, a hall effect sensor picks up the change in magnetic field and will apply a breaking mechanism to one cart. The leading cart is equipped with a magnet facing the following cart and the following cart will be equipped with a hall effect sensor facing the first cart. The output voltage of the Hall effect sensor is then used to determine the distance between the carts. The following cart is configured with a DC motor where if the carts get too close to each other, the cart that is following will slow down.

## Getting Started

Open up MATLAB and simply run the simulation and the validation Arduino code in order to run the experiment yourself.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB license and Arduino download. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
